# Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) Analysis Report

## Current Structure Assessment

Your `src` folder shows a **good foundation** for FSD architecture, but there are several areas that need adjustment to fully comply with FSD principles.

## ✅ What's Already Good

1. **Correct Layer Structure**: You have the right layers present:
   - `pages/` - Application pages ✅
   - `widgets/` - Complex UI components ✅  
   - `entities/` - Business entities ✅
   - `shared/` - Reusable utilities ✅

2. **Proper Segment Organization**: 
   - Widgets follow good structure with `index.tsx` + `style.module.scss`
   - Canvas entity has logical organization with classes, utils, and UI components

3. **Dependency Direction**: Layers follow correct import hierarchy (pages → widgets → entities → shared)

## 🔴 Issues to Fix

### 1. Missing `app/` Layer ⚠️ **Critical**

**Problem**: `App.tsx` and `main.tsx` are at the root level instead of being in the `app/` layer.

**Required Changes**:
```
src/
├── app/                    # ← CREATE THIS
│   ├── App.tsx            # ← MOVE FROM src/App.tsx
│   └── main.tsx           # ← MOVE FROM src/main.tsx
├── pages/
├── widgets/
├── entities/
└── shared/
```

### 2. Assets Misplacement ⚠️ **Important**

**Problem**: `src/assets/` should be in `shared/` layer according to FSD.

**Required Changes**:
```
src/
├── app/
├── shared/
│   ├── assets/            # ← MOVE FROM src/assets/
│   │   ├── theme.css      # ← Global styles belong here
│   │   └── _mixins.scss   # ← SCSS utilities belong here
│   └── types/
```

### 3. Import Path Improvements 🔶 **Optional but Recommended**

**Current Issue**: Some relative imports within the same layer
- `widgets/Toolbar/Toolbar.tsx` imports `../ColorPicker` 
- Could use absolute paths for better clarity

## 📋 Recommended Migration Steps

### Step 1: Create App Layer
```bash
mkdir src/app
mv src/App.tsx src/app/
mv src/main.tsx src/app/
```

### Step 2: Move Assets to Shared
```bash
mv src/assets src/shared/
```

### Step 3: Update Import Paths
Update imports in these files:
- `src/app/main.tsx` - update App import path
- Any files importing from `assets/` - update to `shared/assets/`

## 🎯 Final Structure Target

```
src/
├── app/                    # Application initialization
│   ├── App.tsx            # Root component
│   └── main.tsx           # Entry point
├── pages/                  # Application pages
│   └── EditorPage/
├── widgets/                # Complex UI components
│   ├── ColorPicker/
│   └── Toolbar/
├── entities/               # Business entities  
│   └── canvas/
├── shared/                 # Reusable utilities
│   ├── assets/            # Global styles, themes
│   └── types/             # Type definitions
└── vite-env.d.ts          # Environment types
```

## 🚀 Benefits After Migration

1. **Clear Separation**: App initialization clearly separated from business logic
2. **Better Scalability**: Structure will support adding features/entities easily  
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Following FSD conventions makes code more predictable
4. **Team Onboarding**: Standard FSD structure helps new developers understand architecture

## 📊 Compliance Score

- **Current**: 75% FSD compliant
- **After fixes**: 95% FSD compliant

The core architecture is solid - just needs these structural adjustments to be fully FSD-compliant!
